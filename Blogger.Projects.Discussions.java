		*************************
		Why Have Code Conventions
		*************************
			* 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.
			* Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.
			* Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers tounderstand new code more quickly and thoroughly.

		**********
		File Names
		**********
			* Every file which is included in the project should be logged in the document with name and usage.
				-----------------------------------------------------------------
				|	File 	|					Usage 							|
				-----------------------------------------------------------------
				|			|Module which is used to send SMS.					|
				|SMSModule	|Methods:											|
				|			|sendSMS(Long mobile_number, String message);		|
				-----------------------------------------------------------------

		*****************
		File Organization
		*****************
			* A file consists of sections that should be separated by blank lines and an optional commentidentifying each section.
			* Files longer than 2000 lines are cumbersome and should be avoided.
